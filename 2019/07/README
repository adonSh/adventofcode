Bit of an unconventional solution. The shell scripts run instances of the
intcode computer and print all possible outputs. The largest output found with
sort is the solution. In the case of part 2 (b.sh), use the make_pipes.sh
script to create named fifos that go before and after each "amplifier." The
begin and end pipes must be kept open during the computation. Just redirect a
cat to the pipe and leave it in the background while you run the script.
